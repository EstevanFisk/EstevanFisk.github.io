### Integrated Retail Intelligence: Demand Forecasting & Automated Pricing

> Born from my experience as a Product Manager identifying friction in the sales cycle, this suite operationalizes advanced analytics for the bicycle retail industry. By combining machine learning-driven price prediction with interactive demand forecasting, the solution transforms complex data into a self-service toolkit. It is designed to empower field personnel with immediate pricing autonomy, eliminating the traditional "pricing-desk" bottleneck and accelerating time-to-close through data-driven decision support.
