### DocChat: High-Stakes Document Intelligence

> Inspired by my experience as an **Air Force Cost Analyst**, DocChat is a multi-agent RAG system designed for technical document audit. Built with **LangGraph** and **Docling**, it features an automated self-correction loop to eliminate hallucinations in dense reports. Deployed serverless on **Modal** to demonstrate production-grade AI engineering.
