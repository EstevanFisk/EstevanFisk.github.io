Navigating complex data landscapes—across both the **private sector and classified environments within the DoD**—has reinforced the reality that analytical results are only as valuable as the transparency behind them. In high-stakes settings, the "black box" is a liability; every number must be defensible, and every methodology must be auditable.

This suite was born from my experience as a **Product Manager** identifying operational bottlenecks in the sales cycle. By applying a **Master’s-level statistical foundation** to the real-world friction I encountered in the field, I have engineered this project as a gold standard for **Literate Programming**. It transitions from a high-level operational audit to deep-dive market optimization, ensuring that strategic recommendations are always backed by a visible, reproducible technical trail.

### I. Executive Sales Performance Dashboard
### The Operational Source of Truth

This primary module serves as the central hub for the analytical framework, providing a real-time audit of revenue health across geographic markets and product categories.

- **Strategic Focus**: Enables stakeholders to rapidly evaluate revenue concentration and monitor "health and wealth" metrics to optimize resource allocation.

- **Technical Highlight**: Features a reactive backend that facilitates seamless drilling from quarterly trends down to weekly localized performance.

- **The Hub**: Contains direct navigational links to the specialized R&D and Behavioral Intelligence reports below.

### II. Strategic R&D: Algorithmic Gap Analysis
### Portfolio Optimization & Market Benchmarking

Addressing the "Market Entry" problem, this module identifies "blind spots" in the current 97-model fleet to establish high-fidelity pricing benchmarks for new configurations.

- **Strategic Focus**: Discovered two distinct "Blue Ocean" opportunities: an Aluminum-frame Over Mountain line and an Aluminum-frame Triathlon line.

- **Technical Highlight**: Leverages an **XGBoost pricing engine** to establish market benchmarks, ensuring internal price parity before a prototype is built.

- **Validation**: Compares XGBoost against Linear and Random Forest architectures to ensure the most robust predictive accuracy.

### III. Behavioral Intelligence: High-Dimensional Market Mapping
### Latent Market Discovery via Clustering

To drive targeted marketing and inventory strategies, this final module uncovers the latent behavioral patterns within a customer base of 30 retail bike shops.

- **Strategic Impact**: Identified four distinct customer profiles, allowing marketing teams to transition from generic outreach to highly targeted, segment-specific campaigns.

- **Technical Methodology**: Employs K-Means clustering and UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) to project high-dimensional similarity into an intuitive 2D space.

- **The "Practitioner" Difference**: Unlike traditional PCA, the use of UMAP preserves the local structure of the data, providing a more accurate visual representation of distinct customer "landscapes."

#### Methodological Note: Built for Auditability
Every report in this suite features **interactive code-folding**. By prioritizing transparency, these documents allow technical peers to inspect the data transformations and model parameters directly inline. This ensures that the methodology is not a "black box," but a fully auditable asset—a requirement I maintain from my background in **regulated and classified environments**.
