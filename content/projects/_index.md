      title: Technical Portfolio
      text: |
        Years of navigating complex data landscapes—across both the DoD and the private sector—have taught me that the most impactful models are built on a foundation of rigorous logic and clean execution. While the bulk of my professional history remains behind corporate firewalls and classified environments, this portfolio serves as a transparent look into my technical methodology.  

        Leveraging my background in Statistics, I use these projects as a proving ground for modern workflows—applying Data Science, Machine Learning, and Agentic AI to solve the types of high-stakes challenges I've encountered throughout my career.
